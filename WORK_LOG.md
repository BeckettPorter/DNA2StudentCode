It just linearly goes through the entire sequence and checks for the STR in a big while loop. It takes 12 seconds to solve all the tests so I definitely need to find a way to do it faster but it isn't bad for a first attempt. I also just added an optimization in the if statement to only check to see if the next couple of letters are equal to the sequence if the current char at index is equal to the first char in the STR. This decreased my times by a lot for the chromosome 22 test down to about 1 second and also decreased my test larger by about 2 seconds. I just went through and commented my code and cleaned it up as well. |

I'm trying to optimize that more, I might find a way to make the .equals operation faster. Update, I tried some more variations of converting the string to an int and it is still slower, I'll probably revisit this in the future but for now I can't really get it working it seems. |
| October 18th | 9:00 - 10:15  | I began completely rewriting all my code to use hashing. I made a few helper methods that I will use to make my code more abstract so I don't just do everything in main. Currently I am just trying to get the hashing to work, it's super slow though because I'm not using the method to shift the hashing by one letter yet, just recalculating the entire hash every time it moves to the next letter. Update: I just got it working, so for all the cases it works but it is still very slow because I haven't implemented the method of only calculating the next char yet. I will do that next and that should speed it up a lot. I also added a helper method to map the DNA sequence chars to indices which works very well for this. Ok I started on the nextHash method that just calculates the next char's hash and shifts it by one but it is really not working and I am incredibly confused, gonna have to work on this later because I have class now though. |

I'm not sure why, I feel like I did the algorithm right so maybe it's not actually an issue with my hashing but other parts in my code? |

This fixed it but I was recalculating the entire string so I needed to transfer it to use the hashNextLetter method instead. I finally got this to work after a while but for testLargest I still keep getting 1 less than the answer. |

I also changed some instance variables to final since I realized they never get changed in the code. I also reordered some instance variables for the order to make more sense. I also added a check to prevent the issue of the answer being 1 less than the desired result in cases where the target string appears many times in a row (ie. testLargest). |
