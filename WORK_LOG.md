| October 9th | 12:35 - 1:05 | I wrote my initial implementation that surprisingly works. It just linearly goes through the entire sequence and checks for the STR in a big while loop. It takes 12 seconds to solve all the tests so I definitely need to find a way to do it faster but it isn't bad for a first attempt. I also just added an optimization in the if statement to only check to see if the next couple of letters are equal to the sequence if the current char at index is equal to the first char in the STR. This decreased my times by a lot for the chromosome 22 test down to about 1 second and also decreased my test larger by about 2 seconds. I just went through and commented my code and cleaned it up as well. |
